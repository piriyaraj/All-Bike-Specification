Bike Chassis, suspension, brakes and wheels was released with the horsepower of 18.8 HP (13.7  kW)).Generally, the cooling system works for 3 necessary functions. First, it removes heat from the engine; second, it maintains the engine operating temperature wherever it works most efficiently; and eventually, it brings the engine up to the proper operating temperature as quickly as doable the Chassis, suspension, brakes and wheels used a Air cooling system for these functions. The meaning of the final drive of bike is simply the last step in the process of transferring engine power to a bike's rear wheel.Main type of the transmissions are Chain, Belt or Shaft. and here Chain is used for this transmission.", "Physical measures and capacities": "here used Single disc for the front brakes.
